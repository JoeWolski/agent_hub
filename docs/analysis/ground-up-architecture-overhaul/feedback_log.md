# Feedback Log

- Initial request: run official multi-agent design workflow for a full architecture decomposition and clean-slate rearchitecture proposal.
- Scope emphasized by user:
  - single source of truth for all runtime config and identity data
  - fallback-branch free architecture (except Docker-in-Docker path/network constraints)
  - fail-fast behavior and strong logging controls
  - no unused/duplicate code/tests/env vars/checks
  - preserve primary no-argument launch UX and secondary nested DIND integration use case
- Environment note captured: execution is currently Docker-in-Docker.
- Blockers observed during workflow execution:
  - repository `.git` and source/docs directories are not writable by current runtime user, so branch switching/commit/doc writes in-repo were not possible.
- Mitigation applied:
  - design artifacts generated in `/workspace/tmp` with workflow-equivalent structure and content.
- Implementation request received:
  - `Use the multi-agent implementation workflow and implement the ground-up-architecture-overhaul feature`.
- Implementation cycle outcome:
  - completed AOH-01 scope: extracted shared helper boundaries into `src/agent_core/shared.py` and rewired CLI/Hub helper delegation.
  - added typed core error classes in `src/agent_core/errors.py`.
  - added helper unit tests in `tests/test_agent_core_shared.py`.
  - generated validation artifacts under `docs/analysis/ground-up-architecture-overhaul/validation/`.
- Validation notes:
  - required task-contract selector `prepare_agent_cli_command or launch_profile` matches no current tests (all deselected); recorded in manifest/report.
  - adjacent identity/runtime/config suites pass.
- Additional implementation cycle:
  - completed AOH-02 foundation by adding `agent_core.config.AgentRuntimeConfig` with startup parsing/validation hooks in CLI and Hub.
  - added config-focused tests in `tests/test_agent_core_config.py`.
- Fresh-audit outcome:
  - `Overall: FAIL` (full architecture-overhaul scope remains incomplete, with AOH-03/AOH-04/AOH-05 still pending and AOH-02 still partial SSOT adoption).
